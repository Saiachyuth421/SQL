Query a list of CITY and STATE from the STATION table.
The STATION table is described as follows:

|  FIELD     | TYPE        |
|------------|-------------|
| ID         | NUMBER      |
|------------|-------------|
| CITY       | VARCHAR(20) |
|------------|-------------|
| STATE      | VARCHAR(2)  |
|------------|-------------|
| LAT_N      | NUMBER      |
|------------|-------------|
| LONG_W     | NUMBER      |
|--------------------------|

QUERY:

SELECT DISTINCT CITY, STATE
FROM STATION;


3. Find the difference between the total number of CITY entries in the table and the number of distinct CITY entries in the table.

QUERY: 

SELECT COUNT(CITY) - COUNT(DISTINCT CITY) AS difference
FROM STATION;

4. Query the two cities in STATION with the shortest and longest CITY names, as well as their respective lengths (i.e.: number of characters in the name). If there is more than one smallest or largest city, choose the one that comes first when ordered alphabetically.
   When ordered alphabetically, the CITY names are listed as ABC, DEF, PQRS, and WXY, with lengths  and . The longest name is PQRS, but there are  options for shortest named city. Choose ABC, because it comes first alphabetically.


QUERY:

(
    SELECT CITY, LENGTH(CITY) AS NAME_LENGTH
    FROM STATION
    ORDER BY LENGTH(CITY), CITY
    LIMIT 1
)
UNION
(
    SELECT CITY, LENGTH(CITY) AS NAME_LENGTH
    FROM STATION
    ORDER BY LENGTH(CITY) DESC, CITY
    LIMIT 1
);
