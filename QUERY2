Query a list of CITY and STATE from the STATION table.
The STATION table is described as follows:

|  FIELD     | TYPE        |
|------------|-------------|
| ID         | NUMBER      |
|------------|-------------|
| CITY       | VARCHAR(20) |
|------------|-------------|
| STATE      | VARCHAR(2)  |
|------------|-------------|
| LAT_N      | NUMBER      |
|------------|-------------|
| LONG_W     | NUMBER      |
|--------------------------|

QUERY:

SELECT DISTINCT CITY, STATE
FROM STATION;


3. Find the difference between the total number of CITY entries in the table and the number of distinct CITY entries in the table.

QUERY: 

SELECT COUNT(CITY) - COUNT(DISTINCT CITY) AS difference
FROM STATION;

4. Query the two cities in STATION with the shortest and longest CITY names, as well as their respective lengths (i.e.: number of characters in the name). If there is more than one smallest or largest city, choose the one that comes first when ordered alphabetically.
   When ordered alphabetically, the CITY names are listed as ABC, DEF, PQRS, and WXY, with lengths  and . The longest name is PQRS, but there are  options for shortest named city. Choose ABC, because it comes first alphabetically.


QUERY:

(
    SELECT CITY, LENGTH(CITY) AS NAME_LENGTH
    FROM STATION
    ORDER BY LENGTH(CITY), CITY
    LIMIT 1
)
UNION
(
    SELECT CITY, LENGTH(CITY) AS NAME_LENGTH
    FROM STATION
    ORDER BY LENGTH(CITY) DESC, CITY
    LIMIT 1
);


5. Query the list of CITY names starting with vowels (i.e., a, e, i, o, or u) from STATION. Your result cannot contain duplicates.

QUERY:

SELECT DISTINCT CITY FROM 
STATION WHERE SUBSTR(CITY, 1, 1) IN ('a','e','i','o','u');


5. Query the list of CITY names ending with vowels (a, e, i, o, u) from STATION. Your result cannot contain duplicates.

QUERY:

SELECT DISTINCT CITY
FROM STATION
WHERE LOWER(SUBSTR(CITY, -1)) IN ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u');


6. Query the list of CITY names from STATION which have vowels (i.e., a, e, i, o, and u) as both their first and last characters. Your result cannot contain duplicates.

QUERY:


SELECT DISTINCT CITY
FROM STATION
WHERE LOWER(SUBSTR(CITY, 1, 1)) IN ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u')
  AND LOWER(SUBSTR(CITY, -1)) IN ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u');


7. Query the list of CITY names from STATION that do not start with vowels. Your result cannot contain duplicates.


QUERY:


SELECT DISTINCT CITY
FROM STATION
WHERE LOWER(SUBSTR(CITY, 1, 1)) NOT IN ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u');
